# ChatBar
Display Twitch Chat in MacBook Pro Touchbar.

# Usage
1. Generate an oauth token for chat login using the [TwitchChat oauth Password Generator](http://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
2. Start the program and enter your Twitch username, oauth token, and channel you want to join.
3. When you are ready, press the chat icon (speech bubble) in the control strip of your touchbar

# Installation
I currently don't provide a bundled app for this project. Your only way to run it is to build it yourself using XCode(If you have no idea how to achieve this, it's probably not worth learning it for the purpose of this gimmick alone).
